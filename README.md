# Twisted-Bilayer-Graphene
This is for electronic structure calculation of twisted bilayer graphene and TMD.

+ For graphene, it includes bands and DOS calculation, reproducing MacDonald's PNAS 2010. The figures are presented in jupyter notebook. The .ipynb's are modified from moireBands.py, which is the main body of this code.

+ For TMD, it reproduced Feng-Cheng Wu's two famous PRL of TMD continuum model. You can use these .py scripts to reproduce single electronic properties, such as bands, dos, tight-binding approximation and berry curvature.
